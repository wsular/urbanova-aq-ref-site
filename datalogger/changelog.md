# Logger program changelog


## 20180413-deploy

### Fixes made

* Fix NTP offset specification; to correct data from previous deployment until
  this release, apply -8hr (specifically: -7h59m52s) offset to timestamps.

### Data Table Changes

* Enable saving data tables to microSD card: *tsdata*, *stats*, *settings_hist*
* In table *tsdata*, remove any suffixes denoting processing. The suffixes are
  still present in table *stats*.
* In tables *tsdata* and *stats*, change capitalization so abbreviations of
  'sulfur dioxide' are `SO2` not `so2`
* New data table *settings_hist* contains historical record of settings used
  by the program, including the user-defined linear scaling applied to gas
  analyzers

### Fixes made

* Add user-defined linear scaling to each gas analyzer, for use in applying
  calibration coefficients
* Exclude flagged data from 2B Tech NO/NO<sub>2</sub> analyzer from final data
  storage
* Maintain logger clock sync using NTP


## 20171222-deploy

This is the original release. 

### Known issues

* No calibration scaling applied to gas analyzers. Some are in good shape but
  others have significant deviations without the appropriate linear scaling.
